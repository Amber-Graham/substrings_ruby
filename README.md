# substrings_ruby
Working with substrings using Ruby

Second project working with Ruby in TOP.

<h2>Reflection</h2>
This was harder than I thought it was
going to be (whoops). I started with
map.uniq, learned all about the new
#tally method, and ended up with scan.

I would really like to continue to work
with this to see if there is a way this
would work with #tally. I may pose this
question to TOP discord to get their 
thoughts on this.
